Known issues:
--------------
1: print function, used by the remote automation server to send output back to watin, truncates output.
This meanas that we can't query for text values longer than ~70 characters. Breaks a lot of the value functions as well as inner outer text etc...

Tests passing:
---------------
All AreaTests (4)
BaseElementCollectionTest (3)
BrowserTests.GoogleFindSearchButtonAndClick
BrowserTests.GoogleSearchWithEncodedQueryStringInGoTo
BrowserTests.WindowStyle
BrowserTests.AutoMoveMousePointerToTopLeft
BrowserTests.GoToUrl

Working on
-----------
BrowserTests.GoToUrlNoWait


Possible refactoring
---------------------
1. FFElementCollection and ChromeElementCollection do not provide additional behaviour, it's all implemented by base JSElementCollectionBase. Maybe kill FF/Chrome classes and just use JSElementCollectionBase?

2. ChromeClientPort and FireFoxClientPort share many similar functions
